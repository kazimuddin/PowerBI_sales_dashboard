Here are 2 points each, why `importFrom()` is generally preferred over `import()` in large packages:

**`import()`**

1. Manual imports lead to a cluttered namespace which can be difficult to manage when working on large projects.
2. Automatic loading of unnecessary items can slow down the package build process.

**`importFrom()`**

1. Importing only specific modules makes it easier for users to selectively import functions or variables, improving code readability and usability.
2. `importFrom()` reduces namespace pollution by avoiding automatic imports, making it easier to reproduce builds with fewer dependencies.
